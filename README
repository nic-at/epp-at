How to use
----------

NIC.AT provides commandline wrappers for an easier startup. Here is an example 
commandline wrapper call for a createdomain transaction:

php createdomain.php --server <user>:<password>@<server>:<port> \
                     --logdir /tmp/epp --domain testdomain.at \
                     --nameserver ns1.test1234.at/2001:628:453:4302::53/2001:628:453:4302::54/192.193.54.34\
                     --nameserver ns1.testdomain.at/1.2.3.4 \
                     --registrant XY1231234 \
                     --techc XY1231234 \
                     --cltrid my-cltrid-0815
     
This command connects to the given registry at <server>:<port>, authenticates 
with the given username/password and does a "create domain" transaction with 
the given parameters.

Such command line wrappers are available for all supported epp transactions. 
Do get the possible parameters for one wrapper just call them without any 
parameters.
